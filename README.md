#### Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


This is my submission for the course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data". In this project, we were told to prepare the data and run an analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset located at <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>.



#### Dataset: *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones*



#### Files
***CodeBook.md***
        A code book that contains the information describing the variables, the data, and  transformations done to clean up the given dataset.

***run_analysis.R***
        A script created to download and prepare the data for analysis. It contains the following steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

***FinalDataset.txt***
        The dataset ready for analysis.
